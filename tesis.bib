@article{Carrasco2016,
abstract = {Bibliographic collections in traditional libraries often compile records from distributed sources where variable criteria have been applied to the normalization of the data. Furthermore, the source records often follow classical standards, such as MARC21, where a strict normalization of author names is not enforced. The identification of equivalent records in large catalogues is therefore required, for example, when migrating the data to new repositories which apply modern specifications for cataloguing, such as the FRBR and RDA standards. An open-source tool has been implemented to assist authority control in bibliographic catalogues when external features (such as the citations found in scientific articles) are not available for the disambiguation of creator names. This tool is based on similarity measures between the variants of author names combined with a parser which interprets the dates and periods associated with the creator. An efficient data structure (the unigram frequency vector trie) has been used to accelerate the identification of variants. The algorithms employed and the attribute grammar are described in detail and their implementation is distributed as an open-source resource to allow for an easier uptake.},

These vocabularies have been developed over the course of decades, and can be put to great use in the development of robust Web services and Semantic Web technologies. The article covers how initial collaboration between the Semantic Web, Library and Metadata communities are creating partnerships to complete work in this area. It then discusses some core principles of authority control before talking more specifically about subject and genre vocabularies and name authority. It is hoped that future systems for internationally shared authority data will link the world's authority data from trusted sources to benefit users worldwide. Finally, the article looks at how encoding and markup of vocabularies can help ensure compatibility with the current and future state of Semantic Web development and provides examples of how this work can help improve the findability and navigation of information on the World Wide Web.

@article{Vavliakis2013,
abstract = {A necessary step for the evolution of the traditional Web into a Semantic Web is the transformation of the vast quantities of data, currently residing in Relational Databases into semantically aware data. In addition, in cases where new ontology schemata are developed, considerable experimentation with real data for testing the consistency of classes, properties and entailment rules is required. During the last decade, there has been intense research and development in creating methodologies and tools able to map Relational Databases with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Although some systems have gained wider acceptance in the Semantic Web community, they either require users to learn a declarative language for encoding mappings or, in case they support friendly user interfaces, they provide limited expressivity. Thereupon, we present RDOTE, a framework for easily transporting data residing in Relational Databases into the Semantic Web. RDOTE is available under GNU/GPL license and it provides friendly graphical user interfaces, as well as enough expressivity for creating automatic and custom RDF dumps of relational data. RDOTE is also compatible with D2RQ and R2RML mapping definitions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ranking queries, also known as top-k queries, produce results that are ordered on some computed score. Typically, these queries involve joins, where users are usually interested only in the top-k join results. Top-k queries are dominant in many emerging applications, e.g., multimedia retrieval by content,Web databases, data mining, middlewares, and most information retrieval applications. Current relational query processors do not handle ranking queries efficiently, especially when joins are involved. In this paper, we address supporting top-k join queries in relational query processors. We introduce a new rank-join algorithm that makes use of the individual orders of its inputs to produce join results ordered on a user-specified scoring function. The idea is to rank the join results progressively during the join operation.We introduce two physical query operators based on variants of ripple join that implement the rank-join algorithm. The operators are nonblocking and can be integrated into pipelined execution plans.We also propose an efficient heuristic designed to optimize a top-k join query by choosing the best join order.We address several practical issues and optimization heuristics to integrate the new join operators in practical query processors. We implement the new operators inside a prototype database engine based on PREDATOR. The experimental evaluation of our approach compares recent algorithms for joining ranked inputs and shows superior performance.},

abstract = {Relational databases are considered one of the most popular storage solutions for various kinds of data and they have been recognized as a key factor in generating huge amounts of data for Semantic Web applications. Ontologies, on the other hand, are one of the key concepts and main vehicle of knowledge in the Semantic Web research area. The problem of bridging the gap between relational databases and ontologies has attracted the interest of the Semantic Web community, even from the early years of its existence and is commonly referred to as the database-to-ontology mapping problem. However, this term has been used interchangeably for referring to two distinct problems: namely, the creation of an ontology from an existing database instance and the discovery of mappings between an existing database instance and an existing ontology. In this paper, we clearly define these two problems and present the motivation, benefits, challenges and solutions for each one of them. We attempt to gather the most notable approaches proposed so far in the literature, present them concisely in tabular format and group them under a classification scheme. We finally explore the perspectives and future research steps for a seamless and meaningful integration of databases into the Semantic Web.},

Fifty-one digital repositories were analysed to determine whether they expressed their records in RDF, offered SPARQL query points searchable by external agents, and used references as property values. The Europeana EDM and OntoWeb models are also described. It is concluded that the use of RDF is unequal and excessively conditioned by the use of applications that automatically convert records into RDF triples. Few of the collections analysed give SPARQL points for external queries. Also, the use of references is linked to applications using different models: EDM or OntoWeb. Collections should enrich their data and define aggregation levels for generated RDF data in order to be disseminated, made accessible, and adapted to the semantic web.},

abstract = {This paper describes a process for mashing heterogeneous data sources based on the Multi-data source Fusion Approach (MFA) (Nachouki and Quafafou, 2008 [52]). The aim of MFA is to facilitate the fusion of heterogeneous data sources in dynamic contexts such as the Web. Data sources are either static or active: static data sources can be structured or semi-structured (e.g. XML documents or databases), whereas active sources are services (e.g. Web services). Our main objective is to combine (Web) data sources with a minimal effort required from the user. This objective is crucial because the mashing process implies easy and fast integration of data sources. We suppose that the user is not expert in this field but he/she understands the meaning of data being integrated. In this paper, we consider two important aspects of the Web mashing process. The first one concerns the information extraction from the Web. The results of this process are the static data sources that are used later together with services in order to create a new result/application. The second one concerns the problem of semantic reconciliation of data sources. This step consists to generate the Conflicts data source in order to improve the problem of rewriting semantic queries into sub-queries (not addressed in this paper) over data sources. We give the design of our system MDSManager. We show this process through a real-life application. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gruber1993,
abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse—definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects—is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

abstract="Motivated by the ongoing success of Linked Data and the growing amount of semantic data sources available on the Web, new challenges to query processing are emerging. Especially in distributed settings that require joining data provided by multiple sources, sophisticated optimization techniques are necessary for efficient query processing. We propose novel join processing and grouping techniques to minimize the number of remote requests, and develop an effective solution for source selection in the absence of preprocessed metadata. We present FedX, a practical framework that enables efficient SPARQL query processing on heterogeneous, virtually integrated Linked Data sources. In experiments, we demonstrate the practicability and efficiency of our framework on a set of real-world queries and data sources from the Linked Open Data cloud. With FedX we achieve a significant improvement in query performance over state-of-the-art federated query engines.",

@article{Daraio2016,
abstract = {This paper proposes an Ontology-Based Data Management (OBDM) approach to coordinate, integrate and maintain the data needed for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy development. The OBDM approach is a form of integration of information in which the global schema of data is substituted by the conceptual model of the domain, formally specified through an ontology. Implemented in Sapientia, the ontology of multi-dimensional research assessment, it offers a transparent platform as the base for the assessment process; it enables one to define and specify in an unambiguous way the indicators on which the evaluation is based, and to track their evolution over time; also it allows to the analysis of the effects of the actual use of the indicators on the behavior of scholars, and spot opportunistic behaviors; and it provides a monitoring system to track over time the changes in the established evaluation criteria and their consequences for the research system. It is argued that easier access to and a more transparent view of scientific-scholarly outcomes help to improve the understanding of basic science and the communication of research outcomes to the wider public. An OBDM approach could successfully contribute to solve some of the key issues in the integration of heterogeneous data for STI policies.},
